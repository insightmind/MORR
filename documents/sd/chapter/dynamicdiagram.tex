This diagram depicts the control flow when the browser is started and the browser extension initialized, up to the point where the browser extension is ready for a recording to start.

\subsection{Capturing a text selection event}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{resources/DynamicDiagrams/CaptureEvent.png}
This diagram depicts the control flow when the browser extension captures a text selection event during a recording. The control flow is described up to the point where the recorded event is handed over to the communication-interface which will attempt to send it to the main application. The control flow for other captured DOM events (meaning events occurring in the website-context) is identical.
