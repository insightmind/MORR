\begin{class}{BackGroundScript}
\clsdcl{class BackGroundScript}

\clsdsp{The BackGroundScript class serves as the main class of the browser extension. It is responsible for creating and starting/stopping the ListenerManager and the CommunicationStrategy.}

\begin{constructors}
\begin{constructor}{public BackGroundScript()}{Initialize the BackGroundScript and thus the browser extension. After this function is completed, the browser extension is ready and awaits a signal from the MORR application.}

\begin{methods}
\begin{method}{public start() : void}{Start all components necessary for a session recording. To be called when a recording starts.}
\end{method}
\begin{method}{public stop() : void}{Stop all components which should only be active during a session recording. To be called when a recording stops.}
\end{method}
\begin{method}{public callback(BrowserEvent event) : void}{Callback to be handed over to all components which create events during a recording. The BackGroundScript class is responsible to forward these events to the ICommunicationStrategy for transmission to the MORR application.}
\begin{parameters}
\para{event : BrowserEvent}{The event to be forwarded to the MORR application.}
\end{parameters}
\end{method}
\end{methods}
\end{class}

\begin{class}{ListenerManager}
\clsdcl{class ListenerManager}

\clsdsp{The ListenerManager is responsible to create all IListeners and keep references to them. The ListenerManager provides methods to start/stop all attached listeners.}

\begin{constructors}
\begin{constructor}{public ListenerManager(configurationString : string)}{Initialize the ListenerManager and therefore all configured listeners.}
\begin{parameters}
\para{configurationString : string}{A valid JSON string containing optional configuration. The configuration determines whether specific event types shall be recorded or not.}
