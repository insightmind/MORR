\chapter{Introduction}

This document summarizes the process of implementing MORR, the realized features
as well as various issues which have been encountered along the way.

Overall, the main challenge of the implementation phase has proven to be
dealing with the various APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) which had to be
utilized in order to aquire the event data. As implementers had little to no
prior experience with most of these APIs, various changes and adjustments had to be made
to the software design as a result. However, the overall design idea remains intact.

Details on the new software design can be found in the updated \textbf{Software Design} document
which will be provided together with this document.
