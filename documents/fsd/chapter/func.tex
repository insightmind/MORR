\section{High-level specification}

\begin{itemize}
    \fspec{Identifiable \glspl{session}}{\Gls{user}}{\applaunched{} \configvalid{}}{When the user starts a \gls{session}-recording by pressing the ``Start Recording''-button, a unique session-ID gets created.}{The core application holds a session-ID which all \glspl{event} recorded during the current \gls{session} will get associated with.}
    \fspec{Event timings}{\Gls{user}}{\sessionactive}{When the user triggers an event specified in chapter \ref{ch:data}, the respective \gls{module} (see \ref{sec:modules}) generates a data-structure (see \ref{sec:events}) associated with the event and add the timestamp to it.}{The data structure associated with the event contains a timestamp describing its time of occurence.}
    \fspec{Event types}{\Gls{user}}{\sessionactive}{When the user triggers an event specified in chapter \ref{ch:data}, the respective module (see \ref{sec:modules}) generates a data-structure (see \ref{sec:events}) associated with the event and add the event-type to it.}{The data structure associated with the event contains a field describing its \gls{event}-type.}
    \fspec{Event processing}{\Gls{user}}{\sessionactive}{When the user triggers an event specified in chapter \ref{ch:data}, the data structure according to this event is processed and filtered by \glspl{module} (see \ref{sec:modules}). If the configuration does not specify to discard the event, the event data structure is sent to the core application by the respective module.}{The event data structure is either held by the core application for serialization or deleted based on a configured rule.}
    \fspec{Configurability}{\Gls{admin}}{\sessioninactive}{An \gls{admin} opens the configuration file and adds/modifies/removes rules affecting the following behavior:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Active \glspl{module}\\Select the \glspl{module} the application is allowed to use
        \item Framerate and video resolution\\The framerate and resolution of the recorded videostream should be configurable to allow the prioritization of either resource efficiency (storage and system load) or quality
        \item Audio\\The recording of audio needs to be toggleable
    \end{itemize}
    }{Restarting the application and starting a new \gls{session}-recording uses the configuration as specified in the changed configuration file.}
    \fspec{Error-checking}{\Gls{user}}{\applaunched{} \configinvalid}{The \gls{user} clicks on the button labeled ``Start Recording''. The application will detect syntactic errors in the configuration file and display an error-message.}{An error-dialogue is shown, informing that the current configuration is invalid. The \gls{session}-recording has not been started.}
    \fspec{\Gls{user} controllability (start)}{\Gls{user}}{\applaunched{} \sessioninactive{} \configvalid}{The \gls{user} clicks on the button labeled ``Start Recording''. The application will parse the configuration file and start a new \gls{session}-recording.}{\sessionactive}
     \fspec{\Gls{user} controllability (stop)}{\Gls{user}}{\sessionactive}{The \gls{user} clicks on the button labeled ``Stop Recording''. The application will stop the current \gls{session}-recording.}{\sessioninactive{} The save-dialogue is shown to the \gls{user}, providing the options to store or discard the recorded session.}
    \fspec{Save-Options}{\Gls{user}}{A \gls{session}-recordings has been stopped and the save-dialogue is displayed.}{The user either chooses the ``Save recording'' or the ``Discard recording'' option shown by the dialogue.}{If the user chose the ``Save recording'' option, the recording is stored on the \gls{device}. If the user chose the ``Discard recording'' option, the recording is deleted.} %%TODO: specify either relative path where recording will be stored, or add this as choice to the configuration file
    \fspec{\Gls{user} awareness}{\Gls{user}}{\applaunched{} \sessioninactive{} \configvalid}{The \gls{user} clicks on the button labeled ``Start Recording''. The application will start showing a yellow border along the screen edges.}{A yellow border is being drawn along the screen edges.}
    \fspec{\Gls{user} instruction}{\Gls{user}}{\applaunched{} \sessioninactive{} \configvalid}{The \gls{user} clicks on the button labeled ``Start Recording''. The application opens an information dialogue.}{A dialogue is being displayed, advising the \gls{user} not to enter any personal or confidential business information.}
    \fspec{\Gls{user} reviewability}{\Gls{user}}{\sessionsavail}{A \gls{user} clicks on the ``Open recordings folder'' button. The application opens a new window, displaying the files in which this \gls{user}'s past recordings have been stored. A recording is considered to belong to the current \gls{user} if it has been created on the Windows-Account which is currently logged in.}{A window is being shown to the user, displaying the files in which his past recordings have been stored.} %%TODO: describe what the user can then do with these files (open with windows media player?)
%%removed the editing-requirement, since have not yet discussed if we could (easily) implement a method to edit the videos without loss of metadata. Also, file deletion is not something we actively need to provide/implement as it's a given on the windows operating system
    \fspec{Event-Data extraction}{\Gls{scientist}}{\sessionsavail}{A \gls{scientist} starts the supplied command-line-tool and supplies the paths of one or multiple recordings as well as an output path as parameters. The tool will start extracting the stored event-data from the recording.}{The event-data has been extracted from the specified recordings and stored in CSV-format (comma separated values) at the location specified as output path. The recordings specified as input files have not been altered.}
%%API-provision doesn't seem to fit in the actor-precondition-postcondition scheme, maybe define it in an extra section. Is this even a functional spec?
\end{itemize}

\section{Core application specification}
The core application has to cover the following responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
    \fspec{Videostream recording}{}{\sessionactive}{}{Each \gls{session} recording contains a \gls{videostream} containing the video-output of the computer in use. The \gls{videostream} forms the basis for every recording.}
    \fspec{\hyperref[sec:system-modules]{System module} invocation}{}{}{}{The application core is responsible for launching \hyperref[sec:system-modules]{system modules} based on availability and global configuration.}
    \fspec{\hyperref[sec:system-modules]{System module} configuration}{}{}{}{The application core is responsible for configuring \hyperref[sec:system-modules]{system modules} based on global configuration.}
    \fspec{\hyperref[sec:on-demand-modules]{On-demand module} detection}{}{\sessionactive}{}{The application core is responsible for listening for incoming connections from \hyperref[sec:on-demand-modules]{on-demand modules} which are realized as extensions to third party software, such as browser-extensions.}
    \fspec{Data consolidation}{}{\sessionactive}{}{The data received from different \glspl{module} needs to be stored in the same container.}
    \fspec{Combinability of \glspl{module}}{}{}{}{The application core needs to be able to function with arbitrary combinations of enabled \glspl{module}.}
    \fspec{Context management}{}{\sessionactive}{}{The application core needs to track the context in which \glspl{event} occur and notify \glspl{module} of changes to it.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Per-module specification}
\label{sec:modules}
This section discusses the default \glspl{module} which will be available and ship with the application at release in order to fulfill the mandatory requirements.

\subsection{System modules}
\label{sec:system-modules}

System modules are \glspl{module} which communicate with the operating system. They are invoked as soon as a \gls{session} is started and only terminate at the end of a \gls{session}. All system \glspl{module} are \hyperref[collecting-module]{collecting modules} as specified in \ref{sec:module-types}.

\subsubsection{Window-management module}

\begin{itemize}
    \fspec{}{}{\sessionactive}{}{The application should record the following interactions with other application's windows:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Focusing a window
        \item Moving a window
        \item Resizing a window
        \item Minimizing/Maximizing a window
    \end{itemize}}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Mouse module}

\begin{itemize}
    \fspec{}{}{\sessionactive}{}{The application should record the following interactions with the \gls{device}'s mouse:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pressing and releasing the left mouse button
        \item Pressing and releasing the right mouse button
        \item Using the scroll wheel
        \item Moving the mouse
    \end{itemize}}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Keyboard module}

\begin{itemize}
    \fspec{}{}{\sessionactive}{}{The application should record the following interactions with the \gls{device}'s keyboard:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Pressing and releasing a key
    \end{itemize}}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Clipboard module}

\begin{itemize}
    \fspec{}{}{\sessionactive}{}{The application should record the following interactions with the \gls{device}'s clipboard:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Copying to and pasting from the clipboard
    \end{itemize}}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{On-demand modules}
\label{sec:on-demand-modules}

On-demand modules are \glspl{module} which are dynamically run or stopped based on the software they are tracking. These \glspl{module} need to register with the application core at runtime. All on-demand \glspl{module} are \hyperref[collecting-module]{collecting modules} as specified in \ref{sec:module-types}.
\subsubsection{Browser module}

\begin{itemize}
    \fspec{}{}{\sessionactive}{}{The application should record the following interactions with the browser:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Opening a new tab
        \item Switching to a tab
        \item Closing a tab
        \item Navigating to a web page
        \item Entering text into a form or input textbox
        \item Selecting text
        \item Hovering over an element %potentially not supported by the extention API
        \item Downloading a file %e. g. data exports as mentioned in the website overview
    \end{itemize}}
\end{itemize}
