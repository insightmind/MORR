\label{ch:nonfunc}
\begin{itemize}
    \item[NF10] Performance\\Running the application and recording a \gls{session} should have no notable impact on a customary \gls{device}'s performance.
    \item[NF20] Accuracy\\The recorded data accurately represents the \gls{user}'s activity. %should to does
    \item[NF30] Usability\\The \gls{user} is able to correctly operate the application by themselves after a 5-minute-long introduction.
    \item[NF40] Extensibility\\The application can easily be maintained and extended.
    \item[NF50] Reliability\\The probability of a failure during a 60-minute \gls{session} is under 2\%. A failure is an unintended termination of a recording \gls{session} with a possible loss of recorded data. This does not apply should the application be run in an unsupported environment or configuration (see chapter \ref{ch:environment}).%% 2% are completely made up without any analysis, adjust if necessary
    \item[NF60] Transparency\\It should be made obvious to the \gls{user} if the application is running.
    \item[NF70] Nonintrusiveness\\The application should not interfere with the \gls{user}'s adopted workflow.
