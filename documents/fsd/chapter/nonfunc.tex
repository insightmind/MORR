\begin{itemize}
    \nfspec{Performance\\Running the application and recording a \gls{session} should have no notable impact on a customary \gls{device}'s performance.}
    \nfspec{Accuracy\\The recorded data accurately represents the \gls{user}'s activity.} %should to does
    \nfspec{Usability\\The \gls{user} is able to correctly operate the application by themselves after a 5-minute-long introduction.}
    \nfspec{Extensibility\\The application can easily be maintained and extended.}
    \nfspec{Reliability\\The probability of a failure during a 60-minute \gls{session} is under 2\%. A failure is an unintended termination of a recording \gls{session} with a possible loss of recorded data. This does not apply should the application be run in an unsupported environment or configuration (see chapter \ref{ch:environment}).}%% 2% are completely made up without any analysis, adjust if necessary
    \nfspec{Transparency\\It should be made obvious to the \gls{user} if the application is running.}
    \nfspec{Nonintrusiveness\\The application should not interfere with the \gls{user}'s adopted workflow.}
