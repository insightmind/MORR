\chapter{Definition of Goals}
\label{ch:goals}

The purpose of this project is to create an application which records the online research process of doctors, who in this case are the users of the application. The focus of the application is to collect data and make it available to data scientists. This chapter gives an overview of the functionality of the product. It describes the informal requirements and is used to establish a context for the technical requirements specification in the following chapters.
