\chapter{Definition of Goals}
\label{ch:goals}

The purpose of this project is to create an application which records the online research process of \glspl{user}. The focus of the application is to collect data and make it available to \glspl{scientist}. This chapter gives an overview of the functionality of the product. It describes the informal requirements and is used to establish a context for the technical requirements specification in the following chapters.


\section{Mandatory Criteria}

\begin{itemize}
	\item[MC10]Data recording\\\Gls{user} interactions during the online research must be recorded.
	\item[MC20]\Gls{user} controllability\\The recording \gls{session} is controlled by the \gls{user}. It must be started and stopped by the \gls{user}.
	\item[MC30]Start notification\\Start notification informs the \gls{user} about the start of the recording \gls{session} and must be showed to the \gls{user} before the start of the recording \gls{session}. 
	\item[MC40]\Gls{user} awareness\\A \gls{user} must be aware of the recording process at any time during the \gls{session}.
	\item[MC50]Confirmation of the saving of the recorded data\\A \gls{user} is asked to confirm if the recorded \gls{session} is to be saved.
	\item[MC60]Past recording \glspl{session}\\A \gls{user} must be able to view the recordings of the past \glspl{session}.
	\item[MC70]Data provisioning\\A \gls{scientist}must be able to extract the recorded data.
	

\end{itemize}

\section{Optional Criteria}

\begin{itemize}

	\item[OC10]\Gls{session} duration\\Minimal/maximal duration of the recording \gls{session} can be set.
	\item[OC20]Inactivity\\A timer can be set in order to stop the recording of an \gls{event} after a certain period of inactivity.
	\item[OC30]Data visualization\\The recorded data can be visualized.(e.g histograms, heatmap)
	\item[OC40]Website-specific event types filtering\\The types of the recorded \glspl{event} can be filtered for any website.

\end{itemize}

\section{Delimiting Criteria}

\begin{itemize}

	\item[DC10]Data interpretation\\The application does not interpret the recorded data.
	\item[DC20]Spying on the \gls{user}\\The application does not secretly monitor and gather information about the \gls{user}.
	
\end{itemize}
