\section{Background}
Nowadays it is hard to imagine a research process that doesn't lead to a complex sequence of different pages in the browser. The main goal in that case is to optimize the online research process by predicting the possible destination page. For that reason a data set that contains the information about user interactions on the varying websites is required. The collected data will be then used by the data scientists for analysis, modelling and prediction purposes.

\section{Project definition}
In the course of this project an application that collects information about the user's behaviour during the online research will be created. The application allows to record the user interactions, such as mouse, keyboard, browser and clipboard interaction events, during the online research sessions and to store them in a local database. The recorded data can be restored from the local database for the future use.

The following chapters of the document specify in details the application requirements.
