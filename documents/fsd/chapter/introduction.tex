\section{Problem statement}
It is nowadays common when researching online to have to browse multiple websites in complex sequences. This problem is addressed by optimizing the online research process with the prediction of potential destination pages using machine learning approaches. Such approaches require data enriched with information about \gls{user} interactions with web pages, which the project aims to provide.


\section{Project definition}
The project aims at developing an application which collects information about \gls{user} behavior during online research. The application allows to record \gls{user} interactions, such as mouse, keyboard and\gls{browser} events. The recorded data is stored and can later on be extracted upon request. 

The following chapters of the document specify in detail the application requirements.
