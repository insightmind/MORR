\section{Problem statement}
Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science which enables machines to autonomously learn from experience and adjust to new inputs. AI can be used to analyse and identify patterns in large and complex datasets fast and precisely. It is nowadays common when researching online to have to browse multiple websites in complex sequences, a problem which can be addressed by optimizing the online research process with the prediction of potential destination pages using AI approaches. Such approaches require data enriched with information about user interactions with web pages, which the project aims to provide.


\section{Project definition}
The project aims at developing an application which collects information about \gls{user} behavior during online research. The application allows to record \gls{user} interactions, such as mouse, keyboard and\gls{browser} events. The recorded data is stored and can later on be extracted upon request. 

The following chapters of the document specify in detail the application requirements.
