\section{User related scenarios}
\newcommand{\see}[1][reference missing]{(see \specref{#1})}
The buttons and the yellow border in scenario 1 to 4 are specified in \ref{sec:sm_userinterface}.

\subsection{Scenario 1: User successfully records a session}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The application displays a button at the bottom right corner of the screen.
    \item \Gls{user} clicks the button to start recording.
    \item The application starts to record and displays a yellow border on screen during the whole recording time to indicate that the \gls{session} is being recorded.
    \item \Gls{user} researches in different databases during recording.
    \item \Gls{user} finishes the research and clicks the same button to stop recording.
    \item The application displays a dialog to ask the \gls{user}, if the recording data should be saved or not.
    \item \Gls{user} clicks "save" to save the recorded data.
    \item The application saves the recorded data and the yellow border disappears at the same time.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Scenario 2: User discards a session}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The application displays a button at the bottom right corner of the screen.
    \item \Gls{user} clicks the button to start recording.
    \item The application starts to record and displays a yellow border on screen during the whole recording time to indicate that the \gls{session} is being recorded.
    \item \Gls{user} is interrupted by multiple received Emails and reads the Emails for a long period of time.
    \item \Gls{user} realizes that the research only takes up 10\% of the total recording time and gives up on recording by clicking the same button.
    \item The application displays a dialog to ask the \gls{user}, if the recording data should be saved or not.
    \item \Gls{user} clicks "discard" to discard the recorded data.
    \item The application discards the recorded data and the yellow border disappears at the same time.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Administrator related scenarios}
\subsection{Scenario 6: Administrator changes configuration}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The \gls{admin} opens the configuration file provided by the application.
    \item The \gls{admin} changes the enabled modules by editing the configuration file and saving it.
    \item The \gls{admin} distributes the changed configuration file to a \gls{user}.
    \item The \gls{user}'s application receives the changed configuration file .
    \item The enabled modules of the application is changed according to the received configuration file.
\end{enumerate}
