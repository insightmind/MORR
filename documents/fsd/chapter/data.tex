\requirementscope{D}{dspec}

The application's main purpose is all about collecting data. This data is supposed to help to find patterns in research activity using a personal computer. Therefore there is a great range of distinctive datasets that are interesting to collect.

\section{Sessions}
\begin{itemize}
\dspec{All \glspl{session} are stored locally in a file-based format and may be uploaded to remote storage. }

\dspec{Each session needs to include the following data:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Unique \gls{session} identifier
	\item Timestamp of start and stop
	\item \Gls{videostream}
	\item \Glspl{event} in chronological order
	\end{itemize}
}

\dspec{Each \gls{session} is contained in a mpeg-4 video container}

\dspec{The \gls{videostream} can vary but must include the following:

	Metadata:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Framerate
	\item Resolution
	\item Bitrate
	\end{itemize}

	Data:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Video
	\item (optional) Audio
	\end{itemize}
}
\end{itemize}

\section{Events}
\label{sec:events}

Each dataset in a \gls{session} is described by an \gls{event}, which has been recognized and issued by a collecting \gls{module}. Each \gls{event} includes multiple properties, which define and describe the \gls{event}.

\begin{itemize}
\dspec{An \gls{event} must always include the following data:
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Timestamp of the occurrence
	\item Identifier of the \gls{module} the \gls{event} was issued by
	\item Type which identifies the \glspl{event} general action, e.g. a "MouseClick"
	\end{itemize}
}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Window Management \Glspl{event}}
