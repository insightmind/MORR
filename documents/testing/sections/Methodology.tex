\chapter{Methodology}

The MORR application is quite heavily dependent on various OS-provided APIs that are difficult or impossible to reliably control and mock for testing purposes. As a consequence, various approaches had to be employed to make testing possible. Despite these efforts, test coverage may still vary depending on the component under test. This chapter describes our testing methodology and details some of the edge cases that are not covered in the same way as the rest of the application.
