    <h1>MORR Integration Tests</h1>
    <p>
        This website contains various tests which have to be conducted manually to simulate real-world-scenarios.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Each test assumes that a recording is active while being conducted.<br>
        You can perform as many of those tests as you want in one single session if all relevant modules are enabled. However, keep in mind that<br>
        examining the results becomes more complex the more events are recorded during a single session.<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        To do so, choose a module from the list below, set the configuration as described and start a recording. Conduct the tests you wish to perform<br>
        and stop the recording. You can then save the JSON file and verify the results.
